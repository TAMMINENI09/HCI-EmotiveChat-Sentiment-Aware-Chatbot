Project Title:
	Sentiment-Aware Chatbot using BERT

Description:
	This project implements a BERT-based chatbot capable of detecting emotions in real-time user conversations and responding empathetically through a command-line interface.

	The system fine-tunes a BERT-base-uncased model on the ISEAR dataset and classifies user inputs into one of six emotions: joy, anger, sadness, fear.

The project includes:

	Model training and evaluation

	Error analysis via confusion matrices

	A live interactive chatbot session in the terminal

How to Run the Project:

	Install required libraries: pip install pandas torch scikit-learn transformers matplotlib seaborn

Ensure the dataset is available:

	Place the ISEAR.csv file in the same folder.

	The dataset must be named ISEAR.csv 

	The dataset should have two columns: content and sentiment.

Run the Python script: main.py

Process Flow:

	Loads and preprocesses the dataset.

	Fine-tunes the BERT model on the emotion-labeled text data.

	Prints evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Precision, Recall.

	Displays a detailed classification report and confusion matrix.

	Launches an interactive chatbot loop in the terminal.

Chatbot Usage:

	After training and evaluation, the chatbot is ready.

	Type any sentence and receive a predicted emotion with a response.

	Type quit to exit the chatbot session.

Project Structure:

	Training: Fine-tuning BERT on the preprocessed emotion dataset.

Evaluation: Performance metrics, detailed classification report, and confusion matrix visualization.

	Error Analysis: Additional confusion matrix for error analysis.

	Live Chatbot: User types text input and receives an emotion-aware response from the chatbot.

Dependencies:

	Python 3.8+

	pandas

	torch (PyTorch)

	scikit-learn

	transformers (Hugging Face)

	matplotlib
